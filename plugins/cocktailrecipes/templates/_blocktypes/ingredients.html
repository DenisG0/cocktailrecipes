{#
Blocks uses Twig Macros to create reusable form elements 
that we can use throughout our templates.
http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/tags/macro.html

If we want to access all of the form macros, we can import
the full form file: {% import "_includes/forms" as forms %}

And then access the macro we want using the 'forms' prefix
to the macro that we want to use:
{{ forms.checkboxSelect({
    name: name,
    options: options,
    values: values,
}) }}

If we want to target a single form element, we can target
that macro specifically as we do in this template below:
#}
{% from "_includes/forms" import checkboxSelect %}

{{ checkboxSelect({
    name: name,
    options: options,
    values: values,
}) }}
